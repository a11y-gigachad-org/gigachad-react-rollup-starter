# ⚛️ React Typescript Rollup Starter

Bare bones [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) template for building React Typescript ES Modules.

## ❓ What can I use it for?

To build React Typescript components that are bundled and served as ES Modules.

## ⚙️ Install

```
npm i gigachad-react-rollup-starter --save-dev
```

## 📖 Usage

`npm run build` bundles files into `dist/index.js` and types into `dist/types/index.d.js`. It includes source maps, as well.

`npm start` builds and watches the files during development.

`npm link` in the module directory and then `npm link <packgage.name>` in any [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) or [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org) repo to develop your component for the browser.
